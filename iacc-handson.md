# Instituto Professional IACC | Hands on Lab	

This hands-on environment provisions the lab virtual machine pre-installed with some tools like Visual Studio 2019, VS Code, SQL express and browsers required to perform the lab.

## Getting Started

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.
